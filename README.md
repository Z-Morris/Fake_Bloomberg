# Fake_Bloomberg
Imitation Bloomberg screen for market correlation and technical analysis

The My_Bloomberg.py script was created in attempt to imitate a bloomberg terminal screen.
Currently, the script has limited functionality, only displaying market correlation,
a stock chart, and minimal technical analysis indicators (RSI, MACD, 200/50 day MA). 

To use the script, download the My_Bloomberg.py file and run it in Jupyter or Python. 
Enter the desired dates and ticker into the GUI and click search. Shortly after, 2 additional
matplotlib pop-up windows should open. 

For an example output, check the .png file in the repository.
